# HPA Models and Inference Strategies from Darek

I have done all the modeling and experimentation via Jupyter notebooks. I am posting both training and inference notebooks in this folder. I will start with raw versions of the notebooks and iteratively clean them up for better readability.

# Models

I used three models from HPA 2018 winning solutions:

- Densenet trained on size 768 from bestfitting
- Densenet trained on size 1536 from bestfitting
- Inceptionv3 trained on size 1024 from pudae

# Inference strategies

I used two inference strategies I developed for the purpose of this competition. I have not found these in the literature. 

- Gap-Mask Inference
- Gridify Inference

# to be continued ...
